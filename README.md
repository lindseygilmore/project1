# GA Project 1 | Nautical Tic Tac Toe 

First project for Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. 

### User Story

A 2-player tic tac toe game where players switch off turns. The first person who plays is player 1 and will show as the anchor piece on the board. The second player will show as a lobster piece on the board. Both players make a play using the mousepad to select which box they want to make their next play. The first player to get (3) in a row wins. The winner gets one point per win.
